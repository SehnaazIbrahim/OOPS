A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.

A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.

When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class. Thus, a class is a logical construct, and an object has physical reality (i.e., it occupies space in memory).

Objects are characterized by three essential properties:

State: The value of the object’s data type (e.g., an integer value or a string).
Identity: A unique identifier that distinguishes the object from others.
Behavior: The operations or actions that can be performed on the object based on its state.
The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable (e.g., obj.intValue).

Although commonly referred to as the dot operator, the formal specification for Java categorizes the . as a separator.

The new operator dynamically allocates memory for an object at runtime and returns a reference to it. This reference essentially represents the memory address where the object is stored. This reference is then assigned to the variable, allowing access to the object.

Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated using the new keyword.

Default Values of Object Members in Java:
      When an object is created, its instance variables are automatically initialized with default values based on their data types. 
Here are the default values for different types:
Primitive types:
      int → 0
      boolean → false
      char → '\u0000'
      float → 0.0f
      double → 0.0d
Reference types (like objects):
      String → null
      Any other object reference → null

EXAMPLE PROGRAM :
class Student {
    String name;       // Default value is null
    int age;           // Default value is 0
    boolean isEnrolled; // Default value is false
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new Student object
        Student student = new Student();

        // Print the default values
        System.out.println("Name: " + student.name);       // null
        System.out.println("Age: " + student.age);         // 0
        System.out.println("Is Enrolled: " + student.isEnrolled); // false
    }
}
